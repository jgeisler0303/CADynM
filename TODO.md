* merge MATLAB symbolics and MAMaS variant into on switchable version
* create wrapper version to generate CADyn input files, execute CADyn including template generation but also give access to CADyn intermediate results via MAMaS
* separate optimized constants and move them to pre_calc
* add alternative generation of recursive calculations
* add derived generalized coordinate equations/variables (p)
