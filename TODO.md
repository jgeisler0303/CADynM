* test auxilliary differential equations
* add external, state and input dependent forces/inputs to auxilliary differential equations
* add joints on elastic bodies
* add template generation
* add linearization
* add some locking for data input, so that any further calculations on the finished system can be cashed
* add alternative generation of recursive calculations
